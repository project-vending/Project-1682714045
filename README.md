#  Data Pipeline MonitoringUse Airflow and Streamlit to create a pipeline monitoring application that monitors the entire pipeline's health from start to end. The pipeline should ensure up-to-date monitoring of data sources, pipelines, dependencies, and dependencies upstream. Furthermore, the monitoring application should carry out automatic email notifications using AWS SNS when failures or breakages are found in the pipeline processes. Additionally, Great Expectations can be used to ensure that data consistency and accuracy are maintained throughout.
